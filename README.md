Overview
This project builds a machine learning pipeline that predicts yearly health insurance claim costs per participant and then calculates a final premium based on business loadings such as expense, risk, profit, and inflation.

It demonstrates a full workflow, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training and optimization, evaluation, and deployment using Gradio.

The app allows users to input customer information and instantly view both the predicted claim cost and the final premium.
